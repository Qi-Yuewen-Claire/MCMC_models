# MCMC Models for Star Classification

This repository is a showcase of my Ph.D. research in Astrostatistics at Texas A&M University, demonstrating the development and application of a novel machine learning binary classification algorithm for star classification. The algorithm innovatively integrates Bayesian statistics with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to introduce precise probability assignments. Rigorously tested on 1TB of simulated data, the algorithm achieved a 90% precision and 93% recall rate. The results have been published in a high-impact scientific journal.
